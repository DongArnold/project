      <h2>The Phases of Exercise: Warm-Up, Stretching, Endurance, and Cool-Dow</h2>
      <p class="leading">Exercise is more than just physical movement; it's about optimizing performance and preventing injury. Understanding and incorporating the key phases of exercise—Warm-Up, Stretching, Endurance, and Cool-Down—into your routine will help ensure you achieve your fitness goals safely and effectively. Below, we’ll dive into each phase and provide tips to guide your workout.</p>

    <h3>The Phases</h3>

        <img src="" alt="warm-up">
        <h4>Warm Up</h4>
        <p>Preparing Your Body for Action Why is warming up important? Warming up prepares your body for exercise by gradually increasing heart rate and blood flow to your muscles. This phase reduces the risk of injury, enhances flexibility, and primes your body for the more strenuous activity ahead.</p>

        <h4>Stretching</h4>
        <p>Enhancing Flexibility and Mobility Why is stretching important? Stretching helps increase flexibility, mobility, and blood flow to your muscles, which reduces the risk of injuries and improves overall performance. It’s important to perform stretching after warming up to prepare your muscles for more intense activity.</p>

        <img src="" alt="endurance">
        <h4>Endurance</h4>
        <p>Building Strength and Stamina Why is endurance important? The endurance phase is where the bulk of your workout takes place. This is the time for cardiovascular exercise and strength training that builds stamina, strength, and overall fitness. It’s essential to push yourself within your fitness level during this phase, but always maintain good form to avoid injury.</p>

        <img src="" alt="cool-down">
        <h4>Cool Down</h4>
        <p>A Safe Transition to Rest Why is cooling down important? The cool-down phase helps your heart rate gradually return to its resting state and reduces the risk of dizziness or fainting. This phase is crucial for preventing muscle soreness and aiding in the recovery process after intense activity.</p>

    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <ul class="grid">
      <li><img src="warmup.jpg" alt="warm-up">
        <h4>Warm Up</h4>
        <p>Duration: 5-10 minutes What to do: A proper warm-up involves low-intensity exercises that increase your body temperature and activate your muscles. This phase should focus on movements that mimic the activity you're about to perform but at a lower intensity.</p>
      </li>
      <li><img src="stretching.jpg" alt="stretching">
        <h4>Stretching</h4>
        <p>Dynamic Stretching (during warm-up) Dynamic stretching involves active movements that stretch your muscles while warming them up. This type of stretching is ideal before your workout as it helps prepare the muscles for the motions they will perform.</p>
      </li>
      <li><img src="endurance.jpg" alt="endurance">
        <h4>Endurance</h4>
        <p>Duration: 20-60 minutes, depending on your fitness goals and activity intensity. What to do: Endurance exercises can include activities like running, cycling, swimming, or circuit training. Incorporating strength exercises such as squats, push-ups, or lunges is also essential to building muscular endurance.</p>
      </li>
      <li><img src="cooldown.jpg" alt="cool-down">
        <h4>Cool Down</h4>
        <p>Duration: 5-10 minutes What to do: During the cool-down, perform low-intensity movements and static stretching. This helps to release built-up muscle tension and improve flexibility. Focus on slow and controlled movements to help your body transition into a relaxed state.</p>
